<p>This tool allows you to make the automatic fixing of source code compared to the rules of style Microsoft .</p>

<p>This Visual Studio's extention it's derived from an Open Source program published on Codeplex at url <a href="http://stylefix.codeplex.com/">http://stylefix.codeplex.com/</a>
The main limitation of StyleCop is due to the fact that the program can only report violations to the rules of style , the burden of 
adjustment is on the programmer . The frustrating thing is that often it is a banality which could be resolved automatically.
AlmaStyleFix remedies the problem by performing the correction of the proposed rules by StyleCop automatically . To fully enhance 
the usability of the product , the product has been designed as an extension to Visual Studio , so you have access to a range of powerful
mechanisms provided by the development environment. During the transformation process, it has been reduced the basic functionality, in 
such a way as to allow to be able to change only the current file. The only language supported is C #. In order for the program to work
correctly, the document MUST be part of a project.</p>
